Comfortable, skillful, modal text editor.

### Philosophy:
#### 1. Meant to be **JUST** a text editor
Therefore it is not:
 - a terminal multiplexer 
 - an operating system

unlike some other text editors are trying to be.

#### 2. Fewer clicks do not mean better
Speed through comfort and intuition.
Five intuitive keystrokes are better than three unintuitive ones.
